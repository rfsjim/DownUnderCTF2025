## Goal
To get a flag from the Discord server.

## Initial Observations
The DownUnderCTF Discord Server has many channels, as this is a beginner warm up challenge to get people used to the style of flags to be found and how the process of submitting flags it shouldn't be too dificult to locate.

## Steps Taken
I started at the top channel and looked for a recent post that looked similar to the format of a flag, sure enough there was an image posted in the _#sponsors_ channel that looked very flag like. The most difficult part of submitting it was reading the text from the image and typing it into the submission box.
